The package reads the marriage patterns from the Choo and Siow 2006
*Journal of Political Economy* paper for the non-reform states of the
1970 wave. It fits a parsimonious homoskedastic logit model. Then it
generates $S$ datasets from the fitted model, and it uses them to test
the estimation methods presented in Galichon-Salani√© 2022.
