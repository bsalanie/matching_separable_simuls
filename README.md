```

## summary

The package reads the marriage patterns from the Choo and Siow 2006
*Journal of Political Economy* paper for the non-reform states of the
1970 wave. It fits a parsimonious homoskedastic logit model. Then it
generates $S$ datasets from the fitted model, and it uses them to test
the estimation methods presented in Galichon-Salani√© 2022.

## reading the data


    The data has 25 types of men and 25 types of women.

We reshape the variance-covariance matrix and we normalize the data to a
unit total mass of households.

``` python
# the number of households in the population
n_households_pop = np.sum(nx) + np.sum(my) - np.sum(muxy)

mus = Matching(muxy, nx, my)
mus_norm = normalize_mus(mus, n_households_pop)

varcovs_norm = reshape_varcov(varmus, ncat_men, ncat_women, n_households_pop)
```

## fitting a basic model

First we need to generate some basis functions.

## generating artificial datasets

## fitting a homoskedastic logit model

## fitting a nested logit model
