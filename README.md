## Install

``` sh
pip install matching_separable_simuls
```

## summary

The package reads the marriage patterns from the Choo and Siow 2006
*Journal of Political Economy* paper for the non-reform states of the
1970 wave. It fits a parsimonious homoskedastic logit model. Then it
generates $S$ datasets from the fitted model, and it uses them to test
the estimation methods presented in Galichon-Salani√© 2022.

## reading the data

``` python
data_dir = get_root_dir() / "matching_separable_simuls" / "ChooSiow70nNdata"
```

``` python
nx, my = read_margins(data_dir)
muxy, varmus = read_marriages(data_dir)
ncat_men, ncat_women = muxy.shape
n_prod_categories = ncat_men*ncat_women
mux0, mu0y = _get_singles(muxy, nx, my)
mu0y = my - np.sum(muxy, 0)
print(f"\nThe data has {ncat_men} types of men and {ncat_women} types of women.")
```


    The data has 25 types of men and 25 types of women.

We reshape the variance-covariance matrix and we normalize the data to a
unit total mass of households.
